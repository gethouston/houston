# Integrations (Composio, platform mode)

How Houston connects third-party apps (Gmail, Slack, …) so agents can act on
them. Composio is the first and only provider today, wired **behind a port** so a
second provider slots in without touching anything above it. This doc covers the
host architecture, the grants model (multiplayer + the NEW local grants), and the
UI map.

## 1. Platform-mode architecture (host)

**Platform model.** Houston holds ONE Composio project API key. Every Houston
user is a plain Composio `user_id` under that project; users never create a
Composio account, they only OAuth the app itself (Composio hosts the dance). The
key is cloud/self-host only — it must never ship in a client binary.

**The port** — `packages/host/src/integrations/provider.ts`
`IntegrationProvider`: `readiness`, `listToolkits`, `listConnections(userId)`,
`connect(userId, toolkit)`, `connection`, `disconnect`, plus the two the agent's
generic tools call: `search(userId, query, acting?)` and
`execute(userId, action, params, acting?)`. Host routes + tools depend ONLY on
this interface; no provider SDK/wire type leaks past its adapter. Availability is
a capability flag (`/v1/capabilities` `integrations`), not a forked build — same
code everywhere, no drift.

**Two adapters, one interface:**
- `ComposioProvider` (`composio.ts`) — the **direct** adapter. Speaks Composio v3
  REST directly (`x-api-key`), no CLI/SDK. Used by cloud + self-host, which hold
  the key. `userId` scopes each user's connections. Connect uses
  `POST /api/v3.1/connected_accounts/link`.
- `RemoteIntegrationProvider` (`remote.ts`) — the **gateway** adapter, the
  desktop's provider. The desktop holds NO key: every port call is forwarded to
  Houston's cloud host `/v1/integrations/*` with the user's Supabase session
  token. The upstream verifies the JWT and re-derives the Composio `user_id` from
  its `sub`, so a client can never act as another user and connections follow the
  user across desktop and cloud. The port's `userId` args are ignored here.

**Registry** (`registry.ts`) — `IntegrationRegistry` keyed by provider id. Empty
registry is valid (integrations off → capability false, routes 404/503). Duplicate
id is a wiring bug (throws), unknown id throws (never silently undefined).

**Session sync (desktop).** The frontend owns the Supabase session; the gateway
adapter needs it fresh. `setIntegrationSession(token | null)` pushes the current
token (null on sign-out). With no session the adapter reports not-ready and throws
`IntegrationSigninRequiredError`, surfaced as an actionable 409/sign-in state.

**Sandbox path.** The agent runtime never talks to a provider directly. Its
generic tools call the host over the per-sandbox proxy
(`routes/integrations-sandbox.ts`); the sandbox HMAC token binds
`{workspaceId, agentId}` (`EnvCredentialVault`), so the route knows which agent is
acting without extra plumbing. `search`/`execute` receive the `ActingContext`
(C2): `actingAs` (per-turn token) or `actingUser` (routine creator's `sub`); the
direct adapter ignores both (identity is the verified `userId`).

## 2. Grants model — which agents may use which app

### Multiplayer (cloud gateway, C4 + C7)
Per-`(user, agent)` grant set of toolkit slugs, owned by the cloud gateway. The
gateway filters `search` to granted toolkits and refuses `execute` of an ungranted
toolkit. See `cloud/docs/contracts/C4-grants.md` and `C1-integrations-api.md`.

**Grants are bounded by an allowlist CEILING (Teams v2, C7).** Two ceilings sit
above the grant set: an **org** ceiling (`org_settings`) and a per-**agent**
ceiling (`agent_settings`). A toolkit is usable only if it is BOTH granted AND
inside the effective allowlist:

```
effectiveAllowlist = intersect(orgCeiling ?? ALL, agentCeiling ?? ALL)
```

`null` = unrestricted (ALL), `[]` = none. The intersection is applied on TOP of
grants, never instead of them. When a ceiling **shrinks**, the gateway PRUNES
now-disallowed toolkits from existing grants so revocation takes effect
immediately. A per-agent **connect carries the agent slug**: the gateway checks
the toolkit against the effective allowlist and auto-grants it to the agent on a
successful OAuth (see `connectIntegration(provider, toolkit, agent?)`).

**Client + UI.** `getAgentSettings` / `setAgentSettings` read/replace the agent
ceiling (`allowedToolkits`, plus the read-only `orgAllowedToolkits` it's
intersected with and the caller's effective `access`; manager-only write).
`getOrgSettings` / `setOrgSettings` read/replace the org ceiling (owner-only
write). Copy lives under `teams:integrations.allowlist` ("Allowed integrations",
"Restrict to specific apps"); an agent tab also lists apps blocked by the
ceiling under `teams:integrations.notAllowed`. The manager editor lives in Agent
Settings > **Access** > **Allowed integrations** (`AgentAllowlistSection`); its
editing surface is `AllowlistAppGrid` — the Integrations-tab app catalog
(search + paginated app cards via the shared `AppRow`/`appDisplay`) with a
per-app allow toggle, not a dense checklist. Full client surface:
`knowledge-base/teams.md`.

### Local / self-host grants (NEW — desktop + self-host parity)
`packages/host/src/integrations/grants.ts` (`LocalIntegrationGrants`) +
`grant-store.ts` (`IntegrationGrantStore` port; `FileIntegrationGrantStore` stores
per-agent JSON at `<agent>/.houston/integration-grants.json`, atomic tmp+rename,
corrupt/missing reads as no-record). Same policy the gateway serves, brought to
single-player. Key semantics:

- **Materialize-on-first-read = all connected.** GET on an agent with NO record
  materializes the record as ALL toolkits the user currently has connected
  (statuses `active`+`error`, never `pending`), persists it, and enforcement
  begins from there. This preserves the old behavior (every agent could use every
  connected app) for existing users while giving a real editable record going
  forward.
- **Provider not ready → `[]` WITHOUT persisting** (signed-out gateway throws
  `IntegrationSigninRequiredError` → same outcome), so a later signed-in read
  materializes the real set instead of freezing an empty one.
- **Concurrency-guarded.** Concurrent first-reads share one in-flight promise —
  the default is computed and persisted exactly once.
- **Enforcement once a record exists.** `grantedOrNull(agentId)` returns the set
  when a record exists, else `null` = "no record, do not filter". The sandbox
  route filters `search` (`filterMatchesToGranted`) and 403s `execute`
  (`isActionGranted` → `toolkit_not_granted`) only when `granted` is non-null.
- **Toolkit attribution.** Search results carry the authoritative `toolkit`
  field. Execute has only the action slug, so it uses the Composio slug convention
  (`toolkitOfAction`: prefix before the first `_`, lowercased —
  `GMAIL_SEND_EMAIL` → `gmail`), matching the gateway's C1 enforcement exactly.
- **Gateway-fronted pods never serve the routes.** `LocalIntegrationGrants` is
  constructed in `buildLocalHost` ONLY when `registry && !gatewayFronted`. On a
  managed cloud pod (`HOUSTON_MANAGED_CLOUD`) the dep is unset → the grant routes
  fall through to 404 and the sandbox proxy enforces nothing (the fronting gateway
  owns policy). Integrations unconfigured (no registry) → also unset → 404.

Routes: `GET`/`PUT /v1/agents/:agentId/integration-grants`
(`routes/integration-grants.ts`). PUT is a replace-set (validated array of
`[a-z0-9_-]+`, deduped; 400 otherwise).

### Client 404 → `null` degradation
`engine-client` `agentIntegrationGrants()` returns `Promise<string[] | null>`:
`null` IFF the host answered 404 (grants unsupported — old build or gateway-fronted
pod); every other error throws. The app hook `useAgentGrants` is typed
`string[] | null`; `useAllAgentGrants` sets `supported=false` once any agent
resolves `null`. **`null` means "unsupported, show no per-agent toggles"; `[]`
means "record exists, nothing granted"** — distinct. The grant PUT mutation
no-ops when the cache is `null`, so it is safe even wired in an unsupported
deployment.

## 3. UI map

Gated on `HOST_BUILD` (`app/src/agents/standard-tabs.ts`) — a deterministic build
constant, not the runtime handshake. Absent in the legacy Rust engine build.

**Shared module** — `app/src/components/integrations/` (`index.ts` is the surface;
pure model in `model.ts`/`app-display.ts`, DOM-free and node-tested). Both surfaces
consume it verbatim — no forked copies. Notable exports: `ConnectMoreAppsSection`
(the always-visible catalog block, below), `AppDetailSheet`, `AppRow`,
`AgentChips`, `PendingConnectionCallout`, `IntegrationDisconnectDialog`, the
gate/flow hooks below, and pure helpers
`browseCatalog`/`splitByGrant`/`pollConnectionUntilActive`. `browseCatalog` sorts
results ALPHABETICALLY by app name (case-insensitive) after filtering.

**Always-visible catalog** — `ConnectMoreAppsSection` (wrapping the internal
`CatalogBrowser`) is a permanent "Connect more apps" section on BOTH surfaces, not
a dialog: a brand-new user with zero connections immediately sees the full ~1000-app
catalog. Apps list A-Z; category is a dropdown (categories A-Z); a search box
filters; "Load more" pages. It excludes already-connected toolkits (surfaced by the
caller's own grids) and renders the `ConnectWaitingPanel` inline for an in-progress
OAuth. There is NO add-apps dialog anymore (`AppCatalogPicker` was deleted).

**Global page** — `app/src/components/integrations-view/`, top-level view
`INTEGRATIONS_VIEW_ID = "integrations-home"` (NOT `"integrations"`, which is the
per-agent tab id — a shared slug would shadow the tab; like `dashboard`/`settings`
a top-level view lives OUTSIDE `STANDARD_TAB_IDS`). Sidebar nav + the render branch
live in `shell/workspace-shell.tsx` / `shell/sidebar.tsx`. TWO stacked sections:
**Connected apps** (a two-column grid of cards, each opening `AppDetailSheet` for
per-agent access; pending/errored connections shown full-width above the grid for
recovery; omitted entirely at zero connections) then the always-visible **Connect
more apps** catalog. Disconnect is scope `everywhere` and names affected agents.

**Agent tab** — `app/src/components/tabs/agent-integrations/`
(`integrations-tab.tsx` re-exports the orchestrator). THREE stacked sections, gated
by a discriminated union: `grants` mode shows **Apps this agent can use** (two-col,
deactivate toggles) + **Apps connected to your account** (connected-but-not-granted
active apps, one-click Activate = grant-add, no OAuth; hidden when empty or
read-only); `degraded` mode (grants `null`) shows all connected apps usable with no
toggles and no account section. Both modes end with the always-visible **Connect
more apps** catalog (auto-granting a fresh connection to this agent in grants mode).
"Manage all integrations" navigates to `INTEGRATIONS_VIEW_ID`.

**Connect flow + pending recovery** — `useConnectFlow` (in the shared module) lives
on the SURFACE, never inside the picker, so closing the dialog never kills polling.
It mints the hosted link, opens the browser, polls until active (a `Waker` backs
the sleep so `checkNow()` wakes an immediate poll and `cancel()` returns
`"cancelled"`), then invalidates connections. In agent context a fresh connection
is auto-granted. An abandoned OAuth is recoverable inline on BOTH surfaces while
the flow is live via the `ConnectWaitingPanel` (Reopen / I have finished / Cancel).
A connection left pending/errored across sessions surfaces a `PendingConnectionCallout`
(pending → Finish connecting; error → Reconnect; both a fresh link) + Remove on the
global page and on the agent tab's own app rows (degraded mode, or grants mode once
granted). An ungranted orphaned pending connection is recovered from the global page
(the agent tab links there via "Manage all integrations"). While any connect is waiting,
other Connect buttons are disabled (single flight). Only outcomes `call()` cannot
see are toasted (timeout, provider-side OAuth failure); a cancel is silent by
design.

**No silent failures.** All engine mutations route through `call()`
(`app/src/lib/tauri.ts`), which toasts + reports once, so the integration hooks
carry NO `onError` (a second toast would double up). See `useAgentGrantMutation`.
