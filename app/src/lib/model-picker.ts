/**
 * Pure decision helpers for the chat model picker (ChatModelSelector).

 * unit-testable without a React renderer (the app has no component test
 * runner — see the sibling *.test.mjs files for the node:test pattern) and so
 * the container stays under the file-size budget.
 *
 * Background (issue #342): provider connection status is fetched
 * asynchronously. Before it resolves, the picker must NOT collapse to a single
 * "Not connected" provider — it shows every provider in a neutral "checking"
 * state until the real status arrives. These helpers encode exactly that.

 * - `checking`     — status not yet known and a fetch is in flight; shown with
 *                    a neutral "Checking..." hint, models disabled. This is the
